It’s time to get some thoughts out of my head about work.

I love being a designer but my day job getting me down. Working on the web is absolutely what I want to do—I love this industry—but I spend my days working on projects I care little for. I have a clear idea about what I want to do next, but I’m still sitting here staring blankly at the computer screen.

I’ve hit a wall, I’m working on things that don’t satisfy me professionally or on a personal level. I’ve felt like this for months—probably since January—so why haven’t I changed anything?

Lack of courage is the obvious reason and probably the most influential. As my perception of what I want to work on next shifts, so does the realisation that my the job I want doesn’t exist at home. I’m comfortable, too comfortable.

To put it simply: I want to solve problems that are worth solving.

We don’t need any more services to enrich our already privileged lives, we need to help people. We need to start solving problems that are worth solving.
