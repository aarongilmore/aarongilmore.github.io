Robert Macfarlane's _Underland_<sup>1</sup> is already one of my favourite reads of the year and I'm only about a third of the way through it.

He speaks about his experiences with such romanticism and I've been adoring the references throughout. The same was true for _The Old Ways_, which I read earlier this year. Here's one of my favourite passages—and an quote from [Louis de Bernières](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Bernières)—for your enjoyment and my future reference:

> Lying there among the trees, despite a learned wariness towards anthropomorphism, I find it hard not to imagine these aboreal relations in terms of tenderness, generosity and even love: the respectful distance of their shy crowns, the kissing branches that have pleached with one another, the unseen connections forged by root and hyphae between seemingly distant trees. I remember something Louis de Bernières has written about a relationship that endured into the old age: 'we had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossom had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two.'
