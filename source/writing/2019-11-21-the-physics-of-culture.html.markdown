Architecture has reignited my curiosity for a more mature web.

I was fortunate enough to attend the annual Peter Rice Lecture for the second year in a row this week and left the lecture hall in awe about the work and principles shared by Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara from Grafton Architects in their lecture titled "The Physics of Culture". 

I mention Shelly even though she didn't speak because one of the core values of Grafton Architects is promoting that "architecture is collaborative". The same is true—or at least should be—for a design practise but maybe we don't instil that enough in our beliefs. 

- architecture impacts on all of us (so does design)
- light affects structure
- the union between the material and the spiritual world as a way to describe the beautiful cathedral in Majorca
- Thinking about a building as a "machine that holds light"
- The skin of cities
- "The structure is immense but it embraces you"
- Architecture is "a silent language that speaks"
- "Art, history, politics, poetry, against hard data" van humbolt?
- Buildings—"the built enclosure of people's lives"
- Thinking about how the air of a city moves through a building
- Peter Rice — committed to collaboration across disciplines
- "The earth is our client"
