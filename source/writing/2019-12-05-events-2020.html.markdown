It's that time of the year where the last event ends and I start thinking about what I want to attend the following year.

I was very fortunate to attend some incredible design, art, and music events in 2019; XOXO, Uenoland, Other Voices, and more. I'm starting to think about what I'd like to attend next year, so I figured I'd share it.

## New Adventures
The fifth edition of the wonderful New Adventures; a conference exploring speculative and critical design, radical inclusivity, climate, sustainability, and much more. It's been years since I attended New Adventures and I'm looking forward to making the journey to Nottingham in January.

## Uenoland
The inaugural Uenoland was a lot of fun, I met some incredible people and really enjoyed the creative nature of the talks. The second edition of Uenoland will be in the autumn of 2020 in San Francisco.

## Do Lectures
I've wanted to attend Do Lectures for many years and I think it's finally time. Talks center around the themes of business, creativity, environment, social change, and wellbeing.

## XOXO
XOXO holds a special place in my heart, a fantastic event full of wonderful people. The festival is held every September in beautiful Portland, Oregon.

## 99U
I've never attended 99U but it's been on my radar for the past couple of years. This year's theme of 'The Creative Self' has peaked my interest and I hope to attend it in June.

## Other Voices
Having just come back from my first ever Other Voices in the far west of Ireland, I'm already planning my return. A very special event centered around music, with talks ([Ireland's Edge ↗](https://www.irelandsedge.net/)) on sustainability, the arts, technology, innovation, storytelling and human experience.

## Likeminds
Something a little different, Likeminds brings together artists, designers, writers, technologists, scientists, and others to address a single theme.

## Material
Material is another conference that I've wanted to attend for the past couple of years. It has an interesting tagline that I'm curious to explore: "a conference exploring the concept of the Web as a material".
