### Learning from the disciplines of architecture<sup>[1](#)</sup> and placemaking<sup>[2](#)</sup> will help us design and build more mature spaces on the web. The web is an important place but increasingly we don't treat it as such.

The term placemaking started to gain traction in the 1960s when notable urbanists like Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte would use it to describe the design of cities for the people who lived in them. "Placemaking capitalises on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people's health, happiness, and well-being."<sup>[3](#)</sup>

The web is a new kind of place that we spend time in but it should be governed by similar to rules to those of placemaking in cities. Why? Because the places we spend time in on the web are important and should be held to higher standards.

People now spend their time on screens, in different types of places. For better or worse, the digital space is where we spend our time. We communicate here, discussing politics, popular culture, literature. We search these places for relationships, love, and meaning. Just like the place making that Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte had to fight for, we too have to fight for better digital spaces.

Facebook is probably the best example of describing a place on the web because—at it's core—that's what it strives to be. But it fails miserably in every aspect of placemaking; it doesn't respect the people who use it, it's a machine designed to make money, and if we look back at the definition of placemaking it fails in promoting people's health, happiness, and well-being.

What would Facebook look like if it was publicly owned and designed around the rules of placemaking? "Move fast and break things" has become the motto for so many tech companies and this lack of maturity shows in the spaces they create online.

I'm part of an online community hosted in Slack, a communication tool. This community has rules; a code-of-conduct, moderators, private spaces for people, all bolstered by a community of people who care about the spaces they are a part of. It's one of the best examples of placemaking on the web but Slack didn't create it, the people behind it did. I wonder if Slack could have made it easier for the community to be setup in the way that it is through more consideration when designing the platform?

There's a design conference held every year in Reykjavik, Iceland called Material. I haven't been (yet) but the tagline of the conference "exploring the web as a material" has always made me curious. Trying to figure out what that term means has lead me to looking at different disciplines to try and discern how they define their materials that are used to make something bigger. The discipline that I kept coming back to was architecture.
