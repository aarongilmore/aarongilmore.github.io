    <h1>Now</h1>
    <p>I'm hunkering down in Belfast and longing to see my friends and family. Things have been up and down with more frequency than ever; today—May 11—is a good day. Meditation, writing, and reading is helping me through this difficult time.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, I'm still employed and enjoying work for the most part. Sometimes though, with the current state of the world, the work feels insignificant. I'm doing a lot of work on the digital side of <a href="https://www.gaa.ie/" target="_blank">GAA</a>, a sports organisation here in Ireland. On the side, I'm writing more than ever about design and trying to distill some thoughts into something readable.</p>
    <p>I do have a good amount of free time in the evenings and at the weekend. This time is spent reading: Nan Shepard's <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25773742-the-living-mountain" target="_blank">The Living Mountain</a>;</em> Lucy Ellmann's <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43412920-ducks-newburyport" target="_blank">Ducks, Newburyport</a>;</em> Lyra McKee's <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53092048-lost-found-remembered" target="_blank">Lost, Found, Remembered</a></em>. Cooking a lot, too. From <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_40FyShUG4/" target="_blank">caesar salads</a> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_StsqPB8p6/" target="_blank">fried chicken sandwiches</a> and everything in between. I was baking <a href="" target="_blank"></a>before it was cool.</p>
