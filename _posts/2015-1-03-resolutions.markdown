title: 2015

I always make resolutions for the new year, realistic ones. 

This year is no different, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want to achieve over the coming year and I’ve narrowed it down to the following:

- Make a meaningful contribution to the web — use design to help people. More services like [Watsi](http://watsi.org), please. Maybe something similar for funding education in developing parts of the world? Who knows.

- Contribute more to Open Source, learn more as a result.

- Read more — not only about design, but about the current situation of the world in general.
 
- See more of the world. First up, Berlin on the 19th.

- Graduate.

- Look after myself, physically and mentally.

- See my friends more.

I’d love to hear what you want your 2015 to be like!
