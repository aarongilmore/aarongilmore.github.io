It’s February, the shortest month, and I didn’t get as much reading done this month as I had hoped. Work has been busy, which is great!

### Articles
1. [A 6 minute intro to AI](https://snips.ai/content/intro-to-ai/)

    More of a resource than an article, but really quite fantastic.

2. [Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber, Susan J. Fowler](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber)

    Susan tells her harrowing story of her time working at Uber and the abuse she suffered there.

    > As most of you know, I left Uber in December and joined Stripe in January. I've gotten a lot of questions over the past couple of months about why I left and what my time at Uber was like. It's a strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying story that deserves to be told while it is still fresh in my mind, so here we go.

3. [When Things Go Missing, Kathryn Schulz](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/13/when-things-go-missing)

    Kathryn Schultz reflects on loss in her life in a beautifully written piece.

    > What I’m really interested in though are the technologies and ideas that are likely to stick around for the long term. Which tools should we be looking out for that will change how we set type on the web and how do we keep those Aldine principles of typography in mind?

4. [Gavin Strange’s guide to living a creative double life, Tom May](http://www.creativeboom.com/features/gavin-strange/)

    An interview with the super talented Gavin Strange.

### Books

1. [Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees](http://amzn.to/2loMSTX)

    Robert Irwin is a very interesting artist. This book by Lawrence Weschler explores his life and career.

### Podcast Episodes
1. [The Daily, The New York Times](https://blog.intercom.com/tina-roth-eisenberg-on-turning-side-projects-into-startups/)

    I've been listened to The Daily this past month. It's a short, daily podcast covering news. Largely political but it's easy to keep up-to-date due to its short form.
