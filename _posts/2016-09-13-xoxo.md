On the Monday after last year's festival I flew straight home and got back to my life, leaving no time to process the weekend I just had.

This year I decided to stay a few extra days to reflect. I was excited to relax on Monday and think about the new projects I want to work on, but instead I found myself floating around SE Portland exhausted, not thinking about work, not thinking about anything, really.

A lot happened this weekend. It's Wednesday now, I'm sitting in Heart Coffee Roasters and I'm still trying to take it all in.

###### Imposter Syndrome
I think this bullshit term crosses everyone's mind when you attend something like XOXO, it's crossed mine many times, but I've come to this conclusion: _Being present at XOXO is validation enough that you belong there. You didn't happen upon the festival by accident. You sought out this community and you're part of it, no matter what you do._

###### Taking Dumb Shit Seriously
This weekend I learned that it's OK to take dumb shit seriously. I've been so focused about making something that matters that I've forgotten that it's OK to have fun, too. Sometimes good things can come out of it, as Simone Giertz reminded me with her toothbrush robot.

The XOXO festival won't return next year, but the community and the good that comes from it is going nowhere.
