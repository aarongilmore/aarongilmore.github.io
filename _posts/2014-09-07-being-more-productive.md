title:  Being More Productive
---

Ever since breaking out of the routine of working for a company I’ve becoming increasingly bad at managing time.

I feel unaccomplished at the end of most days because I’m not working hard enough. The hours I actually get work done are all over the place. Sometimes I find myself having done nothing until 7pm and then working until 1am. I don’t like it, I miss the routine. Getting up early and feeling like you’ve accomplished something by lunchtime is a great feeling. 

I’ve decided to take a leaf out of [Jessica Hische’s book](http://jessicahische.is/thinkingthoughtsonscheduling) and plan my entire week out.

The three main things I’m focusing on at the minute are; teaching myself Objective-C, improving my website, and working on some client projects. Getting in a little more exercise during the week and meeting with friends for lunch would also be nice.

Oh, and [breakfast tacos](https://twitter.com/aarondgilmore/status/508583721109581824/photo/1) at the weekend is my new thing.
