title:  Feeling Like I Can Make Anything
---

I’m sitting in front of my computer, drinking a American pale ale by Beavertown, and I feel like I can make anything. 

I didn’t always feel like this, in fact up until about a year ago I often felt constrained with the limited knowledge I had. And then I realised it’s not about the knowledge you have but the time you wish to spend.

I’ve got myself into this mindset at an invaluable time. I’m about to commence my final year of University in which I’ll have the freedom to create any product I want. I wish to explore a deeper level of problem solving, but I’m struggling to come up with ideas. I want to create something truly useful, I want to help people — but how?

There are endless possibilities for digital products and products that we can use in the real world. So many problems to solve and re-think. Time is the only factor.
