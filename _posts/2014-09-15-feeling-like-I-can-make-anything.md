title:  Feeling Like I Can Make Anything
---

I’m sitting in front of my computer, sipping on an APA by Beaverton Brewery, and feel like I can make anything. 

I didn’t always feel like this, in fact up until about a year ago I often felt constrained with the limited knowledge I had. There are endless possibilities for digital and physical products. So many problems to solve and re-think. Time is the only factor. 

It’s a important time for me personally to be in this mindset. I’m about to commence my final year of University in which I’ll have the freedom to create anything I want. I want to explore a deeper level of problem solving. I want to create something truly useful, I want to help people — but in what way?
