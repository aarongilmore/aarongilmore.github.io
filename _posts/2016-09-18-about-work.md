I love working on the web, but my current job is getting me down. Every day I sit at my desk staring blankly at my computer screen wondering what the hell I'm doing. I’ve been working on things that don’t satisfy me professionally or on a personal level and I’ve felt like this for months. I have a good idea about what I want to work on next, so why haven’t I changed anything?

Lack of courage is the obvious reason and probably the most influential. As my perception of what I want to work on shifts, so does the realisation that the job I want doesn’t exist in Belfast.

And I keep saying "I need to save a little more" or "I want to have the right job lined up before I quit" but how much is enough and will I ever know if _that_ job is the right one without giving it a shot?

I have a lot things I want to work on outside of my day job; I'm working on a [magazine](http://readmaker.org/) and I'm eager to work on some fun side projects. As far as my main work goes, it's simple: If I can find a company working on a problem that, in my eyes, is worth solving then I want to be a part of it.
