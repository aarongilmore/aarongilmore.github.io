title:  "Moving on from Brewbot"
---

It's been an amazing year working with [Brewbot](www.brewbot.io) as a Product Design Intern, but it's time for me to move on. Over the past year I've had the chance to work on an amazing product with a very talented group of people. It's been a wonderful experience that I'm eternally grateful for.

From running a successful [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cargo/brewbot-the-smart-brewing-appliance) to wheeling Brewbot into the likes of Twitter, Dropbox, Square, and GitHub on a U-Haul dolly. From road-tripping from Portland, OR. to San Francisco in a 30ft RV to being part of the [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com) program in Austin, if only briefly, and all the adventures in between. It's been a wonderful year and I can't thank the guys I've worked with enough.

So what's next for me? Over the next couple of months I'll be working freelance, revisiting personal projects, and travelling. Portland in September sounds good, right?

Good luck to all my friends at Brewbot for the future, they're going to kill it over the next few months. Cheers.
