I always make resolutions for the new year, realistic ones. 

This year is no different, I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want to achieve over the coming year and I’ve narrowed it down to the following:

1. Make a meaningful contribution to the web—use design to help people. More services like [Watsi](http://watsi.org), please. Maybe something similar for funding education in developing parts of the world? Who knows.
2. Contribute more to Open Source, learn more as a result.
3. Read more — not only about design, but about the current situation of the world in general.
4. See more of the world. First up, Berlin on the 19th.
5. Graduate.
6. Look after myself, physically and mentally.
7. See my friends more.

I’d love to hear what you want your 2015 to be like!
