I started drinking coffee at a very young age. Of course at the time, my mug would have been filled with sugar and milk to try and cut the then harsh taste.

It wasn't until last year that I really started getting into coffee. The level of complexity in such a simple drink was fascinating to me.

When picking good coffee I always look for the roast date, the variety, and the farm it comes from. If I can, I'll also chat the barista to see what else they can tell me about it.

There are five key variables to consider when brewing coffee:

- Temperature
- Surface area
- Time
- Pressure
- Ratio

I now take a lot of care in making coffee. I drink it black, I like to taste how the coffee changes during the time it takes to drink it. This is how I make my coffee:

## Tools

- [Aeropress](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Aerobie-AeroPress-80R08-Coffee-Maker/dp/B000GXZ2GS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397769326&sr=8-1&keywords=aeropress)
- [Salter Slim Scales](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Salter-Design-Electronic-Platform-Kitchen/dp/B000ZNM51O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1397769343&sr=8-2&keywords=scales)
- [Porlex Tall Hand Grinder](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Porlex-345-12541-Tall-Hand-Grinder/dp/B0002JZCF2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397769372&sr=8-1&keywords=porlex)
- iPhone (timer)
- [Britta Filter](http://www.amazon.co.uk/BRITA-Marella-White-Water-Filter/dp/B000B4OA5Q/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1397769404&sr=8-2&keywords=britta)

## Ingredients

For Aeropress, a good ratio to stick by is 60g of coffee per litre of water. This works out at 15g/250ml.

- 250ml of filtered water, heated between 90ยบ and 95ยบ
- 15g of fresh beans, I'm currently brewing [Cult of Done Espresso](http://www.workshopcoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/cult-of-done-espresso) by [Workshop Coffee Co.](http://www.workshopcoffee.com)

## Method

Water on. I allow the water to warm as I grind the beans, I turn the kettle off just before it starts boiling. This isn't exactly accurate, but it ensures the water is around the 90ยบ mark when I use it.

I weigh out 15g of beans on my scales and grind them. You can find out more about using the Porlex grinder [here](http://www.barista-shop.gr/image/data/products/espressoequipment/manual-grinders/Porlex-Coffee-Grinder-Instructions-Manual-by-barista-shop.pdf).

I favour the inverted Aeropress method. Making your coffee this way will ensure no water drips through into the mug when you're extracting. I find it results in a more consistent brew. I pour the grounds into the Aeropress, place it on the scales and zero them.

I place the paper filter in the filter cap and run it under the tap to clean out any fibres and to allow it to expand.

Now I begin pouring my water into the Aeropress. As soon as the first drop hits the coffee I begin the timer. 1min 30secs total. I pour slowly until the scales reach 250g (250ml).

I remove it from the scales and stir three times with the stir paddle. Then I apply the filter cap and push down slowly to release the air. You'll see some liquid come through the holes when all the air is released. This means when you flip the Aeropress back over, no liquid will escape.

I flip the Aeropress and rest it over my cup until the timer reaches 1min, then I do a 30sec press and my coffee is ready.

The whole process takes about 5 minutes. I like to enjoy the beverage while watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer before work.
