The past couple of months I've been actively trying to reduce the time I spend looking at screens. It wasn't until I downloaded [Moment](https://inthemoment.io) for iOS that realised the staggering amount of time I was logging on my phone.

<sup>Time logged in December and February</sup>

Instagram had a shockingly high number—2 hours a day in some cases—closely followed by other social media apps (no surprises there). Moment is useful becasue you can set daily goals. Before using it I was spending 4–5 hours per day on my phone, now I'm down to ~2.5 hours per day.

The app has some handy Insight and Coach features but I mainly use it to nofity me as I get closer to my daily limit.
