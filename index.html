  <p>My name is Aaron and I design and build websites with a focus on functional interaction design, good typography, speed, and simplicity. I split my time between agency work, freelance work, and side projects. Currently, I work remotely for a London-based agency and I'm based in Belfast, Northern Ireland.</p>
  <p>Outside of work I love to travel, brew coffee, and read. You can find out more about me and my work in my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oyior539im6qib9/r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">résumé</a>.</p>
