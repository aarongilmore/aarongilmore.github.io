    <h4 class="zeta">Purpose</h4>
    <p>Designers are problem solvers but not all problems are worth solving. The Web is incredibly powerful, yet as an industry we invest time, money, and resources in products and services for those privileged enough to use them. Don't get me wrong, most of these things are great but what if we spent more time working on products that could help people?</p>
    <h2 class="delta">I want to solve problems that are worth solving, problems in which good design can be useful.</h2>
    <p>Technology can't solve everything, but it can help. It can help with healthcase in third-world countries, with education, with charity, and with communication.</p>
    <p>These are my long-term core values as a designer.</p>
