      <h2 class="f3 lh-title mb1 fw3 black-80">Branding</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy measure">The Sports Fusion brand was in need of a refresh when I joined but it was important that it retained its distinctive characteristics, mainly so thier clients and potential clients could recognise it.</p>
      <h3 class="f4 lh-title fw3 black-80">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="lh-copy measure">The old logo, as seen below, is dated and doesn't sit well in any of thier up-to-date systems.</p>

      <h2 class="f4 lh-title fw3 black-80">Wordmark Refresh</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">The Sports Fusion wordmark has been recognisable by thier clients for a number of years, so reflecting its original design was important. We had to keep the same orange/grey branding colours, but slightly tweak them so they weren't so contrasting with each other.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">Many variations were produced and the brand colours were updated. The final wordmark is set in Proxima Nova Soft with a little extra tracking to improve legibility at various sizes. It was important that the wordmark could scale for various uses; signage at shows, branding for documents, email signatues, business cards, and in the footer of client systems.</p>

      <h2 class="f3 lh-title mb1 fw3 black-80">Marketing Website Redesign</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">Sports Fusion needed a more up-to-date website to showcase products and clients.</p>
      <h3 class="f4 lh-title fw3 black-80">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="lh-copy">The old version of the website hadn't been updated in some years. The company needed a better way to advertise their services in detail.</p>

      <h3 class="f4 lh-title fw3 black-80">The Solution</h3>
      <p class="lh-copy">The system was wireframed using pen and paper, designed in Sketch, and built using <a href="http://concisecss.com/" class="link gold dim">Concise</a> (SCSS, Gulp), a bloat free framework for front-end development.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">The project was interesting, it allowed me to experiment with some tools I hadn't previously used extensivley; tools like Flexbox, keyframe animations, and Gulp (to build production ready versions of the site).</p>

      <p class="lh-copy">Sports Fusion's main focus is in delivering software solutions for coaching, schools, and stadium tours. I worked on these systems, mainly in a front-end capacity, over the past two years.</p>

      <h2 class="f3 lh-title mb1 fw3 black-80">Templating System</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">The last project I worked on with Sports Fusion was an internal tool for generating bespoke systems for client proposals. It's in early stages, but it's essentially a build system that generates a version of the companies core services, branded for a client.</p>
      <p class="lh-copy">The system uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="link gold dim" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://astrum.nodividestudio.com/" class="link gold dim" target="_blank">Astrum</a>, and SCSS to make it easy for system generation with a few high level code changes. Astrum, a pattern library, is used to keep a living library of all the elements of the Sports Fusion systems to benifit developers and new employees.</p>
      <h2 class="f4 lh-title fw3 black-80">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="lh-copy">The way the company currently builds prototypes for client proposals is inefficient. The above system solves this problem by using pre-processing SCSS, includes for global elements, and a pattern library. In theory it allows the team to build prototype in hours rather than days.</p>
