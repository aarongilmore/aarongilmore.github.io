    <h4 class="zeta">My Typical Design Process</h4>
    <p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/21/how-do-you-design-interaction/">Design starts with words</a>, so cleary defining goals and thinking about solutions through writing is the first step of my process. This is followed by roughly sketching out wireframes and app flows on paper.</p>
    <p>When prototyping interactions and flows I like to use <a href="http://framerjs.com/">Framer.js</a>. I then move into building, testing, and iterating the product.</p>
