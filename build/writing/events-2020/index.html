  <h1>Events In 2020</h1>
  <div>
    <p>It's that time of the year where the last event ends and I start thinking about what I want to attend the following year.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to attend some incredible design, art, and music events in 2019; XOXO, Uenoland, Other Voices, and more. I'm starting to think about what I'd like to attend next year, so I figured I'd share it.</p>

<h2 id="new-adventures">New Adventures</h2>
<p>The fifth edition of the wonderful New Adventures; a conference exploring speculative and critical design, radical inclusivity, climate, sustainability, and much more. It's been years since I attended New Adventures and I'm looking forward to making the journey to Nottingham in January.</p>

<h2 id="uenoland">Uenoland</h2>
<p>The inaugural Uenoland was a lot of fun, I met some incredible people and really enjoyed the creative nature of the talks. The second edition of Uenoland will be in the autumn of 2020 in San Francisco.</p>

<h2 id="do-lectures">Do Lectures</h2>
<p>I've wanted to attend Do Lectures for many years and I think it's finally time. Talks center around the themes of business, creativity, environment, social change, and wellbeing.</p>

<h2 id="xoxo">XOXO</h2>
<p>XOXO holds a special place in my heart, a fantastic event full of wonderful people. The festival is held every September in beautiful Portland, Oregon.</p>

<h2 id="u">99U</h2>
<p>I've never attended 99U but it's been on my radar for the past couple of years. This year's theme of 'The Creative Self' has peaked my interest and I hope to attend it in June.</p>

<h2 id="other-voices">Other Voices</h2>
<p>Having just come back from my first ever Other Voices in the far west of Ireland, I'm already planning my return. A very special event centered around music, with talks (<a href="https://www.irelandsedge.net/">Ireland's Edge ↗</a>) on sustainability, the arts, technology, innovation, storytelling and human experience.</p>

<h2 id="likeminds">Likeminds</h2>
<p>Something a little different, Likeminds brings together artists, designers, writers, technologists, scientists, and others to address a single theme.</p>

<h2 id="material">Material</h2>
<p>Material is another conference that I've wanted to attend for the past couple of years. It has an interesting tagline that I'm curious to explore: "a conference exploring the concept of the Web as a material".</p>
