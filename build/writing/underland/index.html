  <h1>Underland</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Robert Macfarlane's <em>Underland</em><sup>1</sup> is already one of my favourite reads of the year and I'm only about a third of the way through it.</p>

<p>He speaks about his experiences with such romanticism and I've been adoring the references throughout. The same was true for <em>The Old Ways</em>, which I read earlier this year. Here's one of my favourite passages—and an quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Bernières">Louis de Bernières</a>—for your enjoyment and my future reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lying there among the trees, despite a learned wariness towards anthropomorphism, I find it hard not to imagine these aboreal relations in terms of tenderness, generosity and even love: the respectful distance of their shy crowns, the kissing branches that have pleached with one another, the unseen connections forged by root and hyphae between seemingly distant trees. I remember something Louis de Bernières has written about a relationship that endured into the old age: 'we had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossom had fallen from our branches we found that we were one tree and not two.'</p>
