  <h1>Screen Sabbatical</h1>
  <div>
    <p>I took a short trip to Co. Donegal this past week to recharge after a busy few months. I planned this trip to get away from my computer, to relax and read, to walk around the Donegal countryside without thinking about work.</p>

<p>On the Thursday when I arrived I largely did what I planned to. I read Carl Sagan’s ‘Cosmos’ all day and through his charasmetic words was transported through the Universe. My phone was on 5% from the day’s journey and I found myself checking it once or twice in the evening to see if anyone had tried to contact me. When I looked at the screen I was greeted by a list of notifications; Kickstarter emails, Quora answers, Reminders.</p>

<p>I set my phone down that night and let it die. The next day—16th December—I didn’t look at a single screen. Not a phone, or a television, or a Kindle. It was strange, I tried to recall the last time I went through a full day screenless. Our lives are built around screens, it was impossible to place, likely sometime in the mid 90s but I really can’t remember. When did you last go a full day without looking at a screen?</p>

<p>I walked, I read, I wrote (this in my notebook, in the evening). I found a sense of comfort in the glow of the fire and the singing of the kettle. It was a welcome change from the brightness of a screen and the sometimes anxiety inducing buzz of a phone.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I do love technology, but I need more of these “screen sabbaticals”, I implore you to give it a go.</p>
