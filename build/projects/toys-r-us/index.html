    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>I teamed up with the folks at Dawson Andrews when I freelancing to help them deliver a new experience for Toys"R"Us. In this case study I will showcase some of the issues at the heart of the problem of the e-commerce organisation, the approach to the solution, and the highest performing design solutions we provided and implemented.</p>
    <p>But first, some key highlights from this project:</p>
    <ul class="measure">
        <li>Overall Conversion Rate <span class="bg-light-yellow">increased by 20.74%</span></li>
        <li>Cart Abandonment on Mobile <span class="bg-light-yellow">decreased by 74.6%</span></li>
        <li>Mobile Revenues <strspan class="bg-light-yellow"ong>increased by 42.3%</span></li>
        <li>Cart to Checkout Conversion <span class="bg-light-yellow">was up 210.4%</span></li>
        <li>Add to Cart <span class="bg-light-yellow">went up by x3</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>On Smaller Screens</h3>
    <p>For the best part of a year I worked on various aspects of the Toy"R"Us redesign but the area I really focused on was mobile. With 60%+ users experiencing the website on mobile we knew it would be a key area to target in our digital transformation.</p>
    <p>Through research and development we were able to produce a simplified mobile experiece that saw some great improvments in conversion:</p>
    <ul class="measure">
        <li>Mobile Conversion Rate <span class="bg-light-yellow">increased 46.33%</span></li>
        <li>Tablet Conversion Rate <span class="bg-light-yellow">increased 6.3%</span></li>
        <li>Mobile Penetration (i.e. what percentage on mobile of overall revenues) <span class="bg-light-yellow">increased 14.1%</span></li>
    </ul>
