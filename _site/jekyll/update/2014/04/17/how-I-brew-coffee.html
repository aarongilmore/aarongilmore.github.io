<p>I started drinking coffee at a very young age. Of course at the time, my mug would have been filled with sugar and milk to try and cut the then harsh taste.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until last year that I really started getting into coffee. The level of complexity in such a simple drink was fascinating to me.</p>

<p>When picking good coffee I always look for the roast date, the variety, and the farm it comes from. If I can, I&#39;ll also chat the barista to see what else they can tell me about it.</p>

<p>There are five key variables to consider when brewing coffee:</p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Surface area</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Pressure</li>
<li>Ratio</li>
</ul>

<p>I now take a lot of care in making coffee. I drink it black, I like to taste how the coffee changes during the time it takes to drink it. This is how I make my coffee:</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>For Aeropress, a good ratio to stick by is 60g of coffee per litre of water. This works out at 15g/250ml.</p>

<ul>
<li>250ml of filtered water, heated between 90ยบ and 95ยบ</li>
<li>15g of fresh beans, I&#39;m currently brewing <a href="http://www.workshopcoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/cult-of-done-espresso">Cult of Done Espresso</a> by <a href="http://www.workshopcoffee.com">Workshop Coffee Co.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>Water on. I allow the water to warm as I grind the beans, I turn the kettle off just before it starts boiling. This isn&#39;t exactly accurate, but it ensures the water is around the 90ยบ mark when I use it.</p>

<p>I weigh out 15g of beans on my scales and grind them. You can find out more about using the Porlex grinder <a href="http://www.barista-shop.gr/image/data/products/espressoequipment/manual-grinders/Porlex-Coffee-Grinder-Instructions-Manual-by-barista-shop.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I favour the inverted Aeropress method. Making your coffee this way will ensure no water drips through into the mug when you&#39;re extracting. I find it results in a more consistent brew. I pour the grounds into the Aeropress, place it on the scales and zero them.</p>

<p>I place the paper filter in the filter cap and run it under the tap to clean out any fibres and to allow it to expand.</p>

<p>Now I begin pouring my water into the Aeropress. As soon as the first drop hits the coffee I begin the timer. 1min 30secs total. I pour slowly until the scales reach 250g (250ml).</p>

<p>I remove it from the scales and stir three times with the stir paddle. Then I apply the filter cap and push down slowly to release the air. You&#39;ll see some liquid come through the holes when all the air is released. This means when you flip the Aeropress back over, no liquid will escape.</p>

<p>I flip the Aeropress and rest it over my cup until the timer reaches 1min, then I do a 30sec press and my coffee is ready.</p>

<p>The whole process takes about 5 minutes. I like to enjoy the beverage while watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer before work.</p>
