      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello my friend, my name's Aaron and I'm a designer and developer.</p>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I love the web as a medium but it has grown selfish in its pursuits. We have immense power at our fingertips but rarely do we use it responsibly. I'm as guilty of this as anyone. I've worked on projects in the past that have brought me joy and I'm proud to have been a part of them but I know I can do so much more with this computer.</p>
        <p>So, my purpose in this industry is to help people who really need it&mdash;through design and communication. I'm not there yet, I'm still working on products that only exist to make money but I'm starting to think in the right direction.</p>

      <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>Outside of working on the web I enjoy travelling. Working remotely gives me the advantage of being able to travel quite often. So far this year I've been to Berlin, Edinburgh, and London. Upcoming trips: Portland, OR. in September and Amsterdam in November.</p>
        <p>I'm massively into brewing coffee. I find the ritual of brewing every moring an important catalyst to a productive work day.</p>
        <p>Craft beer is also a huge passion of mine. Not just drinking it, but brewing it and thinking about the data surrounding the brewing process.</p>
