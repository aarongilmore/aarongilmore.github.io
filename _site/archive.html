          <p class="date">26 Jul 2015</p>
          <p><p>I’m just about to finish my second month working remotely and to be honest, although the majority of it is great, it has some negative aspects too.</p><br></p>

          <p class="date">03 Jan 2015</p>
          <p><p>I always make resolutions for the new year, realistic ones.</p><br></p>

          <p class="date">09 Oct 2014</p>
          <p><p>Ideas are hard. Like, having to actually come up with something is hard. Usually ideas come out of nowhere, at random times; in the shower, while out running, or after one too many beers.</p><br></p>

          <p class="date">19 Jun 2014</p>
          <p><p>It’s been an amazing year working with <a href="www.brewbot.io">Brewbot</a> as a Product Design Intern, but it’s time for me to move on. Over the past year I’ve had the chance to work on an amazing product with a very talented group of people. It’s been a wonderful experience that I’m eternally grateful for.</p><br></p>

          <p class="date">02 Jun 2014</p>
          <p><p>I started drinking coffee at a very young age but It wasn’t until last year that my interest in coffee really started to grow. The level of complexity in such a simple drink became fascinating to me and I wanted to learn a lot more about it.</p><br></p>
