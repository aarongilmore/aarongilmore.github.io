		<p class="tc mt0 mb5"><span class="f6 gray"></span></p>
		<p><strong>Between</strong> Me</p>

<p><strong>And</strong> You</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2>

<p>I will always do my best to fulfil your needs and meet your goals, but sometimes it is best to have a few simple things written down so that we both know what is what, who should do what and what happens if stuff goes wrong.</p>

<h2 id="so-in-short">So in short;</h2>

<p>You <strong>Company Name</strong>, located at <strong>Company Address</strong> are hiring me <strong>Forename Surname</strong> to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Description about the work you’ll be doing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For the total price of <strong>xxxx.xx</strong>, as outlined in our previous correspondence.</p>

<p>Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-both-parties-agree-to">What do both parties agree to?</h2>

<p><strong>You</strong>: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You’ll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways, so you’ll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I have the experience and ability to do everything I’ve agreed with you and I’ll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I’ll endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set and on top of that I’ll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.</p>

<h2 id="timelineworkday">Timeline/Workday</h2>

<p>The contract, as discussed, will be for a duration of <strong>time period</strong> starting <strong>start date</strong> and ending on <strong>end date</strong>. Any additional work can be discussed at a later stage.</p>

<p>If either party wish to terminate the contract, a grace period of <strong>14 days</strong> must be given.</p>

<p>My work week is <strong>Monday-Friday, 9am–5pm</strong>, with 1 hour for lunch. The majority of my work week will be carried out remotely with <strong>2 days</strong> work on-site (3 days when I can). When on site, I prefer to work from <strong>8am—4pm</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="additional-development">Additional Development</h2>

<p>Any additional development needed above and beyond what we have agreed to here must be accompanied by an additional contract which I will be happy to provide upon request. <strong>I retain the right to refuse additional work that is not specifically outlined in this document</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>All communications will be made during regular business hours (<strong>Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm BST, excluding holidays</strong>). Of course I understand that emergencies do arise, so in the case of one know that my hours will be billed at time and a half (I keep a record of all my hours in <strong>Harvest</strong>). I appreciate communication in a text-based medium when I’m not on-site, but understand that not all discussions are easily done this way. I’m always happy to speak to you on the phone or over Slack.</p>

<p>As I value your time as well as my own, I ask that all meetings be scheduled a minimum of two business days in advance and be accompanied by an agenda so that I can be fully prepared.</p>

<h2 id="legal-stuff">Legal stuff</h2>

<p>I’ll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience.</p>

<p>That said, I can’t guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I can’t be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them.</p>

<p>Your liability to me will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be liable to me or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if we’ve advised you of them.</p>

<p>Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<h2 id="displaying-the-work">Displaying the work</h2>

<p>I reserve the right to display all aspects of our creative work, including sketches, work-in-progress designs and the completed project on my portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and in books. Of course, I will always respect NDAs when they’re in place.</p>

<h2 id="payment-schedule">Payment schedule</h2>

<p>I’m sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that I send you promptly, below is the payment schedule I need to you adhere to.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When you will be sending invoices</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All invoices will be issued electronically.</p>

<h2 id="but-wheres-all-the-horrible-small-print">But where’s all the horrible small print?</h2>

<p>Just like a parking ticket, neither of us can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.</p>

<p>We both agree that we’ll adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.</p>

<p>This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.</p>

<p>Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of <strong>appropriate country</strong> courts.</p>

<h2 id="the-dotted-line">The dotted line</h2>

<p>Signed by and on behalf of <strong>Me</strong>:</p>

<p>Signed by and on behalf of <strong>You</strong>:</p>

<p>Everyone should sign above and keep a copy for their records.</p>
