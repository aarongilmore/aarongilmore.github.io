		<p>I’m just about to finish my second month working remotely and to be honest, although the majority of it is great, it has some negative aspects too.</p>

<h3 id="the-5-second-commute">The 5 Second Commute</h3>
<p>Being able to get out of bed and be in the office in less that 5 seconds has me sleeping in more often than not. It’s just too easy to hit the snooze button and I feel like my day gets off to a bad start every time it happens.</p>

<p>Before working remotely, when I had to rise early, it was great. It allowed me to get into a really good routine—the best I’ve ever had. For the first few months of the year I was getting up ~06:30 and hitting the gym before starting my work day and I felt mentally and physically wonderful. When I get up at 08:30 and start work at 09:00, it takes my brain a good 30 minutes before it kicks fully into “work mode”. Last week I woke up at 08:45 and had a pretty awful day because of it.</p>

<p>It’s also very easy to not exercise at all. It’s easy to move from bed, to desk, to sofa without get any exercise in between. Good thing I started running more the past few weeks after work.</p>

<h3 id="forever-alone-sort-of">Forever Alone, Sort of</h3>
<p>Although I communicate on a daily basis with my co-workers, it can get a little lonely not actually interacting with other people. I miss the social aspect of being in an office, surrounded by people.</p>

<p>Sometimes I don’t leave the house for days on end. It’s great at first, not having to commute, but you miss getting out and about. I try to combat this by getting out of the house 2-3 times a week and heading to a coffee shop to work, but the convenience of staying at home often wins.</p>

<p>As an introvert, there’s a balancing act of spending time with people and recharging on your own. Working remotely is tipping the scales in a negative way for me. Maybe I should get a dog.</p>

<h3 id="to-summerise">To Summerise</h3>
<p>Working remotely is good, but it can be difficult. I wanted a remote job so I could have the freedom to move around and maybe work in different cities throughout the year—I didn’t want to commit to living somewhere, but I havant taken advantage of that yet. I want to take advantage of this soon and I’m sure I will see the true benefits of working remotely more when I do.</p>
