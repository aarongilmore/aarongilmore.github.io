		<h3 id="wheels-within-wheels">Wheels Within Wheels</h3>

<h4 id="by-dervla-murphy">by Dervla Murphy</h4>

<p>Dervla Murphy retells her difficult upbringing in Ireland.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="dubliners">Dubliners</h3>

<h4 id="by-james-joyce">by James Joyce</h4>

<p>I’ve been fascinated with James Joyce this year. Dubliners paints a picture of Ireland at the turn of the 20th century through 15 short stories oozing realism.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-happy-prince-and-other-stories">The Happy Prince and Other Stories</h3>

<h4 id="by-james-joyce-1">by James Joyce</h4>

<p>The magic of Oscar Wilde never fails to satisfy. I particularly enjoyed The Rose and Nightingale.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-trial">The Trial</h3>

<h4 id="by-franz-kafka">by Franz Kafka</h4>

<p>My first taste of the troubled mind of Kafka. Life can be utterly absurd.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="out-on-the-wire-uncovering-the-secrets-of-radios-new-masters-of-story">Out on the Wire: Uncovering the Secrets of Radio’s New Masters of Story</h3>

<h4 id="by-jessica-abel">by Jessica Abel</h4>

<p>A fun graphic novel about public radio!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="seeing-is-forgetting-the-name-of-the-thing-one-sees">Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees</h3>

<h4 id="by-lawrence-weschler">by Lawrence Weschler</h4>

<p>This book explores the life and work of Robert Irwin and it really helped me understand art. Robert’s work is particularly interesting.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-library-of-alexandria-centre-of-learning-in-the-ancient-world">The Library of Alexandria: Centre of Learning in the Ancient World</h3>

<h4 id="by-roy-macleod">by Roy MacLeod</h4>

<p>Theories and facts about the ancient city of Alexandria and its great library.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="full-tilt-ireland-to-india-on-a-bicycle">Full Tilt: Ireland to India on a Bicycle</h3>

<h4 id="dervla-murphy">Dervla Murphy</h4>

<p>Another fascinating adventure with the wonderful Dervla Murphy.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h3>

<h4 id="by-james-joyce-2">by James Joyce</h4>

<p>Well, I finally did it. Ulysses was difficult to read but it stands out as a truly unique piece of literature. I enjoyed reading it, but finished it feeling like I needed a second round—I’ll give it a few years though.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="stardust">Stardust</h3>

<h4 id="by-neil-gaimen">by Neil Gaimen</h4>

<p>This was good, but I really struggled to get into it and I don’t know why. It has all the makings of great Gaimen fantasy but I never quite got drawn into the story.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-innovators">The Innovators</h3>

<h4 id="by-walter-isaacson">by Walter Isaacson</h4>

<p>Loved this. A fascinating overview of some of the pioneers of modern computing. From Ada Lovelace to Licklider to Gates.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="dark-matter">Dark Matter</h3>

<h4 id="by-blake-crouch">by Blake Crouch</h4>

<p>Yes! Really suspenseful fiction. Kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="where-wizards-stay-up-late-the-origins-of-the-internet">Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet</h3>

<h4 id="by-katie-hafner--matthew-lyon">by Katie Hafner &amp; Matthew Lyon</h4>

<p>Another fascinating piece of text on the beginnings of the Internet.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="sick-cities-psychology-and-pathology-of-american-urban-life">Sick Cities: Psychology and Pathology of American Urban Life</h3>

<h4 id="by-mitchell-gordon">by Mitchell Gordon</h4>

<p>It’s interesting reading these books ~50 years after they were written to compare projections of that time with today. Economics, population growth, urban expansion, transportation have in some cases blown their expected projections.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="neuralink-and-the-brains-magical-future">Neuralink and The Brain’s Magical Future</h3>

<h4 id="by-tim-urban">by Tim Urban</h4>

<p>Tim Urban making difficult topics easy to understand.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-physics-biology-and-environmental-ethics-of-making-mars-habitable">The Physics, Biology, and Environmental Ethics of Making Mars Habitable</h3>

<h4 id="by-christopher-p-mckay--margarita-m-marinova">by Christopher P. McKay &amp; Margarita M. Marinova</h4>

<p>This is a more technical insight into making Mars habitable, which is interesting. It was, however, published in 2001 so some of the research and data has most likely changed.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</h3>

<h4 id="by-yuval-noah-harari">by Yuval Noah Harari</h4>

<p>A fairly broad and digestible account on the history of human kind.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="deep-thinking-where-machine-intelligence-ends-and-human-creativity-begins">Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins</h3>

<h4 id="by-garry-kasparov">by Garry Kasparov</h4>

<p>A really fascinating look at AI from the perspective of a chess Grandmaster. A lot of focus on Kasparov’s matches against Deep Blue—the chess-playing computer built by IBM.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-death-and-life-of-great-american-cities">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</h3>

<h4 id="by-jane-jacobs">by Jane Jacobs</h4>

<p>As ever, Jane Jacobs takes a compassionate and spirited approach to discussing the topic of urban planning.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-happened">What Happened</h3>

<h4 id="by-hillary-clinton">by Hillary Clinton</h4>

<p>Regardless of what is said about Hillary Clinton in the press, she comes across a genuine and caring person. It’s without a doubt she would’ve been a better president than he who got elected, she was robbed.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="occupy">Occupy</h3>

<h4 id="by-noam-chomsky">by Noam Chomsky</h4>

<p>Several interviews and conversations with Chomsky. A lot of repeated points due to the nature of this “pamphlet series”. Time would be better spent reading Chomsky’s other work.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="a-leg-to-stand-on">A Leg to Stand On</h3>

<h4 id="by-oliver-sacks">by Oliver Sacks</h4>

<p>This was great. Sacks takes a seemingly straightforward scenario and explores it to its fullest. His medical descriptions and his storytelling are very enjoyable.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="on-tyranny">On Tyranny</h3>

<h4 id="by-timothy-d-snyder">by Timothy D. Snyder</h4>

<p>A lot of good lessons in this book.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="a-peoples-history-of-the-united-states">A People’s History of the United States</h3>

<h4 id="by-howard-zinn">by Howard Zinn</h4>

<p>The history lesson they don’t teach in schools, American schools anyway. A pretty dense look at America’s history from Columbus right through to the turn of the 20th century, recommend if you’re into history of class, capitalism, racism, war, politics.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-portrait-of-the-artist">The Portrait of the Artist</h3>

<h4 id="by-james-joyce-3">by James Joyce</h4>

<p>Probably the most accessible of Joyce’s work. This follows the early life of Stephen Dedalus, one of the main characters in Ulysses.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-river-of-consciousness">The River of Consciousness</h3>

<h4 id="by-oliver-sacks-1">by Oliver Sacks</h4>

<p>The final body of work from the great Oliver Sacks.</p>
