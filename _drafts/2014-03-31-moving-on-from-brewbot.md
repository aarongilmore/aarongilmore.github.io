It's been an amazing year working at [Brewbot](www.brewbot.io) as a Product Design Intern, but it's time for me to move on. Over the past year I've had the chance to work on an amazing product with a very talented group of people. It's been a wonderful experience that I'm eternally grateful for.

From running a successful Kickstarter campaign to wheeling Brewbot into the likes of Twitter, Dropbox, Square, and GitHub on a U-Haul dolly. From road-tripping from Portland, OR. to San Francisco in a 30ft RV to being part of Techstars, Austin, if only briefly, and all the adventures in between. It's been wonderful and I can't thank the guys I've worked with enough.

So what's next for me? Over the next couple of months I'll be working on some current freelance projects, revisiting personal projects, and travelling to Portland, OR. to drink beer, eat delicious food, and hang out with friends. I'll also be preparing for my final year of university, which begins mid-September.

It's time for another adventure.
