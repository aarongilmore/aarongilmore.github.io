**September**

_Week 1_

Final stages of Brewbot development before Kickstarter launch at XOXO. This week we finalised designs for the various merchandise that would be available as a pledge in the Kickstarter campaign. This included coasters, t-shirts and beer paddles.

I focused on the beer paddles and got the opportunity to go to FabLab Belfast (http://www.fablabni.com/) to manufacture them. I used the laser cutter to cut and engrave the coasters and the CNC mill to cut the shapes for the beer paddles. 

I also worked a lot with 3D CAD software to help explain parts of the Brewbot to Mette (http://www.mettecreates.com/).

_Week 2_

In the second week of September we received our high fidelity prototype from Mette (http://www.mettecreates.com/). The prototype needed plumbed and hooked up to the electronics, I got to help out with part of this process by creating 3D diagrams of the inner workings and assisting the plumbing process.

We tested Brewbot before it left for Portland and we shipped it on the 12th.

_Week 3_

We arrived in Portland on the 15th of September, Brewbot arrived two days later.It was tested and prepared for it's unveiling at XOXO and at the same time the team worked on the digital aspects of the products; including the iOS app, the website and the Kickstarter page.

We had planned to launch Brewbot on the first day of XOXO, the 19th, but we were delayed until the 21st because of issues  surrounding Kickstarter's policies. 

Late on the 20th we had to miss most of the XOXO activities to get Brewbot ready for launch. A video had to be produced, showing Brewbot in action and we had to beef up the content on the website.

We finally launched on the morning of the 21st and got a very good response. Andy McMillan, organizer of XOXO, Build and The Manual was the first backer and Max Tempkin, owner of Cards Against Humanity was the first person to buy a Brewbot.

We were fortunate to get a spot in the XOXO Unmarket, along side products such as Field Notes (http://fieldnotesbrand.com/), Ouya (https://www.ouya.tv/), Cards Against Humanity (http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/) and Little Printer (http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/).

Crowds of people gathered round to hear us talk about Brewbot and the pledges started rolling in. We made £4000 in the first day and got to over £10,000 a couple of days later.

_Week 4_

Week 4 brought with it a huge volume of emails, messages from bakers and tweets. We spent a huge amount of our time replying to them. As the questions rolled in they began to repeat themselves, from that we began to build a FAQ document. I helped draft up replies to the various questions we were getting, in tandem with working on press release content.

We had a huge shift in sales from the 23rd to the 27th. In this time we jumped from £10,000 to £50,000.

Towards the end of the month we rented a 30ft RV, loaded Brewbot into it and drove to San Francisco. 

During our time here we got the chance to visit Dropbox, Square, Twitter and GitHub. The people who worked there were so excited about Brewbot. It's pretty amazing to have people who work on products you use and love get excited about something you have built.

The night we began our journey back to Portland was also the night Twitter were throwing an Oktoberfest party in their Market St. office. We rolled up to Twitter HQ in our RV with Brewbot in tow and wheeled it inside on a trolley. We got a chance to talk about Brewbot to hundreds of Twitter employees, it was very well received. Straight after the party we hit the I5 and made our way back to Oregon. 

We arrived back in Portland around lunch time the next day. My boss Chris did some insane driving endurance the night before, with me co-piloting; both fueled by In-N-Out burgers, Gatorade and beef jerky. 'Murica.

 **October**

_Week 1_

The first week in October was spent responding to more emails and trying to spread the word about Brewbot. In the weeks after the launch, we managed to get Brewbot featured on sites such as TechCrunch, Mashable, Uncrate, BoingBoing and Yahoo!. We even returned to Belfast with a small article published in New Scientist. Pretty insane.

_Week 2_

Our last week in Portland. We got a chance to explore a little this week, even though the emails and work didn't stop. Brewbot got packed up and shipped back to Ireland around the 12th. We flew home on the 15th and after close to 30 hours of traveling, we caught up on some sleep.

Brewbot hit it's goal of £100,000 on Friday 18th. 

_Week 3_

We decided to throw a countdown party in The Hudson so that we could have all the people from Northern Ireland who supported us there.

This week I worked on building a Shopify web page that would host all of Brewbot's merchandise. T-shirts, paddles, coasters etc.

The process allowed me to get familiar with the _.liquid_ templating language, which Shopify developed.

_Week 4_

We hosted a countdown party in The Hudson Bar. Over 70 of our friends and supporters showed up to join in the celebrations. 

UTV even popped by to film the event.

All-in-all Brewbot raised £114,368 from 381 backers. 

This week we began working on merchandise suppliers and shipping companies. Over the next few weeks we need to fulfil the orders  of over 100 t-shirts and 80 sets of uniquely engraved coasters.

I also started working on a 3D prototype of Brewbot Core, our smaller product that allows users with a home brew setup to control and automate it.

**November**

_Week 1_

Merchandise was the main focus of this week. We finalised designs for the t-shirts and got them sent off to the printers. During the next few weeks our attention would be drawn to finalising the artwork for the beer paddles and the drinks coasters. 

_Week 2_

Build. The final Build took place in Belfast from the 11-14 November. We got to take some time off and attend the conference. It was great because it gave us the chance to talk more about Brewbot and also talk to people that had already backed us. 

The first few days of the conference focused on workshops and getting people together at fringe events. I went to a coffee tasting workshop with Mark Ashbridge of Established, and a food fermentation workshop.

The day of the conference brought with it a host of excellent speakers. My favourite talks were those by David Cole, Jason Scott, and Frank Chimero.

David's talk focused on the future we are building together and how we, as designers, can have an impact on that. You can view the material from that talk [here](http://irondavy.quora.com/Applied-Discovery-Presentation-from-Build-2013).

Jason's talk was very interesting and completely different to the others. He calls himself an "Archivist". Jason and the team he works with spend their time downloading websites that are being shut down in an attempt to save peoples personal data. 

Frank's talk, What Screens Want, explored what designing for screens actually means. He put forth some interesting concepts like the relationships between the physical world and the digital world.

_Week 3_

After Build we got straight back into merchandise. We were nearing the end of our deadline to ship t-shirts to our backers and we were no closer to finding the right manufacturer for our coasters and beer paddles.

I got in contact with various manufacturers throughout the week and managed to find one in England that would make the coasters at a reasonable price. We prepared the artwork, ran some tests and got the ball rolling on that. 
 
_Week 4_

Tasting paddles were the next priority. We contacted a fabricator in Northern Ireland, they ran some test pieces and they weren't very good. Time was really running out for the paddles at this point, the official shipping deadline for some countries including Australia and Canada had already passed and because of that our shipping prices kept going up.

We ended up contacting the company that made our original prototypes, Fab Lab, and although they don't usually manufacture commercially, they allowed us to book the lab for a day. 

I readied the artwork the night before, but the next morning we found some problems with it. The PDF's were originally generated in a program called Processing (using Java), when we imported them into Illustrator everything seemed fine. The PDF's looked ok when I was exporting them, but when we opened them in the software that controls the laser cutter, we found a lot of hidden anchor points in each of the 50 files. Nightmare. It took us to almost 1pm to get the files sorted again. 

During the time taken to fix the files we were able to cut all the tasting paddles in the CNC machine, sand them, and prepare them for the laser cutter. The rest of the afternoon was spent making a few more prototypes to see which one we preferred.

We didn't get nearly as much done as we had hoped, but the next day got off to a flying start and we managed to finish all 48 paddles by the end of the day. I spent the last hour or so oiling them with linseed oil and then I brought them back to the office. 

**December**

_Week 1_

The first week in December was all about shipping merchandise to  our backers. We had to pack up over 300 packages, write messages and Christmas cards for all of them and take them round to Royal Mail throughout the week.

It was pretty intense trying to get everything packed and labeled correctly. The entire week was devoted to trying to get as much stuff out as possible. 

There were a few set-backs which didn't help thing; the first batch of coasters we got were not produced to the standard agreed upon, so we had to send them back and get the manufacturer to re-produce them. At least a third of the glasses that came didn't quite fit into the tasting paddles, something we didn't realise until we had already shipped some. We had to email our backers to let them know and check all of the glasses we had already packed. Thankfully none of the glasses we already sent out were defective. 

_Week 2_

The last week of work before Christmas and all of the merchandise has been shipped to our backers, all that's left are a few boxes that we wish to hand deliver to our friends and family. 

The rest of this week will be spent tidying up some side projects and trying to get as much done before the break. Also, Christmas party time.
