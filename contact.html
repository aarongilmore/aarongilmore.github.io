        <h2 class="f3 lh-title fw3 black-80">Process</h2>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">I like to be involved in both the design and development aspect of a project. It's vital when building products that both designers and developers involved understand each other's respective constraints.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">Design starts with words, so cleary defining goals and thinking about solutions through writing is the first step of my process. This is followed by roughly sketching out wireframes and app flows on paper.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">When working on UI, I like to design in Sketch to get a clear idea of what's required. If there's a particular interaction that might prove difficult to develop, I'll protoype it in Framer and get feedback on it to make sure the solution is achievable.</p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">When building for the web I like to use pre-processing for CSS, a build system to automate tasks, and Git to track changes. I'll constantly run various browser and speed tests to ensure the website has optimal usability.</p>
